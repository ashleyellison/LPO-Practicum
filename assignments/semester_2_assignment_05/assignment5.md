# Assignment 5

Using your own dataset, or one of the example datasets, complete the following steps. Use a continuous dependent variable.

1. Create a basic model with four or five key covariates, including continuous, at least two categorical variables and binary variables.
1. Run a model with the dependent variable specified as the log of the dv. In the code, interpret the coefficients from this model and briefly (1 sentence)
discuss the differences between the results from this model and the results from the basic model.
1. Run a model with the continuous independent variable as a quadratic function. Discuss why this expansion should or should not be included.
1. Run a model with an interaction between the continuous independent variable and the binary dependent variable. Using the margins command, create a plot
that shows how the dependent variable changes as a function of these two variables.
1. Run a model with an interaction between two categorical variables, or a categorical variable and a binary variable. Create two tables, on which shows the coefficients,
another which shows predicted levels of the dependent variable as a function of the independent variables.
