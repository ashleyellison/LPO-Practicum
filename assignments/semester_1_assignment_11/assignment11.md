# Assignment 11

For this assignment, please create a do file that will generate your descriptive tables and graphics as you intend to include them in the final version. Also include png files of all of the graphics, and tables in rtf format. For guidance, please consult both the final assignment itself and the example assignment. Please remember that the reason for doing descriptive statistics is to take the reader on a guided tour of the dependent variable or variables, showing how it changes as a function of other variables.
