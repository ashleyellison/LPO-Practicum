#Assignment 2


For this assignment, you'll need to use the California school district
data (caschools.dta). Complete the following steps:

1. Create a categorical variable for district size, dividing districts
by quartiles. Create a variable name for this variable as well as
value labels for each school size as follows: 
    * Small
    * Medium-Small
    * Medium-Large
    * Large
2. Calculate the total number of students enrolled in each type of
   school district (small through large). 
3. Calculate the average reading score, math score, and welfare
   percent in each type of school district (small through large). 
4. Create graphics for districts by size showing the distribution of
   reading scores and math scores. 
5. Create another graphic showing the relationship between
expenditures per student and math scores by district size.

Upload a well-documented and well-organized do file, with the proper
name to your github repo by the deadline. Remember proper
naming conventions for files submitted.
