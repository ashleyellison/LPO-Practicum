## Assignment 9

Use the Mroz data to answer the following questions about female employment.

1. Run a logit model predicting labor force participation based on characteristics of
the woman and of the children.

2. Generate the marginal effects for all of the variables, holding other predictors at
their means.

3. In comments in the do file. Explain why the estimates of an independent variable’s
relationship to the outcome are not constant across population.

4. Generate the predicted probability of working for a range of mother’s years of
education. Create a plot or table for these predicted probabilities.

5. Generated the predicted probability of working for range of mother’s years of education
interacted with husband’s wage. Create a plot or table to explain the
relationship you observe.

6. Does including characteristics related to the husband’s education significantly
increase model fit from your preferred model? Compare predictions of these two
models graphically using the ROC.
