#Assignment 1

For this first assignment, I will ask you to describe a research question and choose a database
to work with. We will revise your research question over the coming months, so consider this
just a first draft. For next week, write a one page summary that contains the following:

  - A problem statement: what is the issue, why is it important?

- A research question: ask a question that will help to illuminate the problem. Your research
question should include the population under study, the unit of analysis, and the
dependent and independent variables. It should also indicate the type of research (quantiative or qualitative) and the direction of the relationship between dependent and independent variables. 

- The data that you wish to use to analyze this question, and if possible, some of the specific
variables which you would like to use.

As mentioned, I will ask you to revise this substantially over the course of the semester, so at
this point, just do your best to create such a statement.

You will need to know about the questions that were asked to develop the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Program, the Education Longitudinal Study, the High School Longitudinal Study
or the Programme for International Student Assessment, or another dataset you might want to work with. The questionnaires are here:

- ECLS[http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/instruments2011.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/instruments2011.asp) 
- ELS [http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/questionnaires.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/questionnaires.asp)
- HSLS [http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/questionnaires.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/questionnaires.asp)
- PISA [http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php]

Taking a look at these questionnaires will help to give you an idea of which research questions
you may be able to answer using these databases.
During the next week, you also should ensure that you have access to Stata and the relevant
data:

-  ECLS [http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/dataproducts.asp/](http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/dataproducts.asp/)
-  HSLS [http://nces.ed.gov/edat/](http://nces.ed.gov/edat/)
-  ELS [http://nces.ed.gov/edat/](http://nces.ed.gov/edat/)
-  PISA [http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php](http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php)
  
You will need your selected dataset to complete assignments for
the course. The first assignment based on these will be due in two
weeks. This assignment is due on Monday night before our next
class. The file should be named asfollows:

  `assignment1_<lastname>.docx`
  
All subsequent files to be turned in should be named the same way.

I want this assignment and all subsequent assignments turned in on [github](http://github.com). You'll need to do the following:

1. Get a github id. It's free. Email me your id as soon as you have it. 
2. Figure out a way to interact with git and github. The easiest way is through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is also free and open source. 
3. Answer your invitation from me to join [lpoprac](https://github.com/lpoprac). 
4. Clone your student directory to your computer. 
5. Save your assignment file in `assignment1` folder. 
6. Push your changes up to github.
