**Assignment 8**

as

Replication is a key part of research that is often overlooked. In this
assignment, you’ll be asked to replicate a famous study comparing
experimental evidence on the effect of job training with observational
data. Each of you will be assigned an observational control group to
work with. In the steps below, when I refer to treatment, control, and
observational groups, I’m assuming that you will be working with *males
only*, and a particular observational group.

For this assignment, complete the following steps:

1.  Read the Lalonde paper, available
    [here](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282%28198609%2976%3A4%3C604%3AETEEOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-P).
    You must read this paper *carefully*, paying attention to the
    specific details of how each model is specified. Footnotes count.

2.  Download the data for the treatment group, the control group and the
    observational control group from Raheev Dehejias site, available
    [here](http://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/nswdata.html).

    Hint: you’re going to need to use the infile command with the
    variable list that is supplied on Dehejia’s website:

    `treat age education black hispanic married nodegree re75 re78 `

3.  Depending on your assigned observational control group, replicate
    table 3, using the data on treatments, controls, and your
    observational control group. Replicate columns one and two for 1975
    and 1978 earnings data, then replicate the column that corresponds
    to your assigned observational control group.

4.  Depending on your assigned observational control group, replicate
    table 5, columns 1 through 9. Replicate row 1 of the table, then the
    row for your assigned observational control group. The resulting
    table or tables should have results from a total of 18 regression
    estimates, nine reporting the results when comparing the
    experimental treatment group with the experimental control group,
    and nine comparing the experimental treatment group with the
    observational control group. Your estimate for treatment *should* be
    the same as the estimate in the LaLonde paper reported in the table.

5.  Output the results in a nicely formatted table or set of tables.

6.  In one paragraph, comment on any differences or difficulties you
    ran into.

7.  In no more than two additional paragraphs, describe what you would
    have done differently to create a user-friendly replication file.
