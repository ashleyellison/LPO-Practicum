## Assignment 4

1. Create a dataset that includes two independent variables, an error term, and a dependent variable that 
is a linear function of the two independent variables. The two independent variables should be correlated with
one another. 

2. Repeatedly sample from that population. 

3. In each sample calculate the value of the regression coefficients. 

4. Report the empirical sampling distribution generated. 

5. Now, allow the correlation between the two independent variables to vary from .05 to .95 in steps of .05. Report what happens to
the empirical sampling distribution in terms of both the mean and the standard deviation. Interpret the results.

You should supply a do file that does all of the above, with comments in the do file answering part 5.
