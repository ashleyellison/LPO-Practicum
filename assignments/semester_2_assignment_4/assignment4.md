## Assignment 4

1. Create a dataset that includes two independent variables, an error term, and a dependent variable that 
is a linear function of the two independent variables. The two independent variables should be correlated with
one another. 

2. Repeatedly sample from that population. 

3. In each sample calculate the value of the regression coefficients. 

4. Report the empirical sampling distribution generated for the constant and both variables. 

5. Now, create a correlation between the error term and one of the coefficients. Discuss what happens to your parameter estimates 
when there is a correlation between one of the coefficients and the error term. Increase the strength of the correlation between the independent variable and the error term and discuss what happens then. 

You should supply a do file that does all of the above, with comments in the do file answering part 5.
