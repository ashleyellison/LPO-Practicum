##Assignment 3
*LPO 9951 | Fall 2015*

For this assignment, you will need to have access to the data you plan to work with this semester (If you're working with a non-NCES dataset, just use one of the datasets we covered in class). With the dataset, complete the following steps:

Using your research question from the first assignment describe briefly 10 variables that you think might be relevant to this study.
Using the dataset that you’d like to work with, find indicators to match the variables you’re looking for.
Generate code to subset your chosen variables from the full dataset.
Describe the data you’ve selected. Include the following information in your description of each continuous indicator:
Mean
Standard error of the mean
Median
Number missing
For categorical indicators, I need a tabulation across the levels of the indicator, including a category for missing data.

NB: Skip weights, etc, and focus on your variables of interest.

For this assignment, you should submit a do file that
subsets the variables you want from the full dataset (saving optional)
generates the proper descriptive statistics
