## Assignment 9
Using the diss.dta file, complete the following steps
1. Run a “pooled” regression, estimating the impact of percent of the population aged 18-24
on appropriations, with appropriate controls
2. Run a separate regression for each year estimating the above relationship. Comment on
any patterns you see.
3. Run a separate regression for each state, estimating the above relationship. Comment on
any patterns you see.
4. Run a model with state fixed effects, comment (in the do file) on the key estimate.
5. Run a model with year fixed effects, comment (in the do file) on the key estimate.
6. Run a model with state and year fixed effects, comment on the key estimate.
7. Run a model with state fixed effects and an appropriate adjustment for autocorrelation.
8. Create a plot that demonstates the impact of percent of the population aged 18-24 on
appropriations, based on your preferred estimate.
