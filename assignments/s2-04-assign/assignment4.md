**Assignment 4**

Prediction is central to the interpretation of regression results. In
this exercise, you’ll be asked to conduct a cost benefit analysis of
changing the student-teacher ratio in California using both prediction and forecasting.

1.  Using the California schools dataset, estimate a model that
    identifies the predicted impact of an additional student per
    teacher, controlling for expenditures per
    student, cal works percent, and free/reduced meal percent on
    test scores. Create a graphic that shows the predicted impact of
    increasing the number of students per teacher over its range with uncertainty
    around the prediction.

2.  Assume that a policy has been suggested that will lower class sizes by 5 students per teacher.
    Holding all another values at a reasonable level, predict the impact
    of this increase on student test scores at the district level, with
    an appropriate statement of uncertainty. Remember that what you’ll
    need to be doing here is forecasting. Assume that you’ll be going
    from the current value to 5 students lower. 

3.  The legislature is now debating a range of policies, from an
    decrease of 5 students to a decrease of 10 students per teacher. Predict the
    impact of an increase from the minimum suggested level to the
    maximum suggested level, again with an appropriate statement
    of uncertainty. Plot the result in a manner appropriate for
    presentation to an interested lay audience.


5.  In a separate document, comment on the coefficients estimated in the
    model, including their direction and significance. Report the
    results of your predictions, interpreting them for an interested
    policy audience.  Then describe the uncertainty around your forecast of increasing from the current ratio to the lower level. Make sure to include a graphic for your state legislator.
