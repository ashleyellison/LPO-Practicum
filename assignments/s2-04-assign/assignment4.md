**Assignment 4**

Prediction is central to the interpretation of regression results. In
this exercise, you’ll be asked to conduct a cost benefit analysis of
increasing the number of computers per student for the state of
California using both prediction and forecasting.

1.  Using the California schools dataset, estimate a model that
    identifies the predicted impact of an additional computer per
    student, controlling for student teacher ratios, expenditures per
    student, cal works percent, and free/reduced meal percent on
    test scores. Create a graphic that shows the predicted impact of
    increasing computers per student over its range with uncertainty
    around the prediction.

2.  Assume that a policy has been suggested that will provide each
    district with an additional 10 computers for every 100 students.
    Holding all another values at a reasonable level, predict the impact
    of this increase on student test scores at the district level, with
    an appropriate statement of uncertainty. Remember that what you’ll
    need to be doing here is forecasting. Assume that you’ll be going
    from around 10 computers per 100 students to the higher value.

3.  The legislature is now debating a range of policies, from an
    increase of 10 computers per 100 students to 40 per 100. Predict the
    impact of an increase from the minimum suggested level to the
    maximum suggested level, again with an appropriate statement
    of uncertainty. Plot the result in a manner appropriate for
    presentation to an interested lay audience.

4.  Assume that each additional computer costs $500. Calculate the
    cost/benefit ratio of an increase of 10 computers per 100 students
    for the state as a whole in terms of dollars per increase in
    test scores. (Hint: you have enrollment numbers for each district in
    the variable enrl\_tot. )

5.  In a separate document, comment on the coefficients estimated in the
    model, including their direction and significance. Report the
    results of your predictions, interpreting them for an interested
    policy audience. Describe how much it would cost to increase the
    number of computers per student in the state by 10 computers per
    student, both as a total and as a per student measure. Then describe
    the uncertainty around your forecast of increasing from the current
    ratio to the higher level. Make sure to include a graphic for your
    state legislator.
