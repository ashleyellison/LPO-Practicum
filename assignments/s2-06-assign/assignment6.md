## Assignment 6

1. Using your own dataset, specify a model that uses a continuous variable as the dependent variable and includes at least one continuous variable on the right hand side. 
1. Create a additional model that includes a log transform of the dependent variable. In the document, describe the coefficient for a key covariate-- what does the coefficient say about the relationship between the independent and dependent variable? How does it differ from the coefficient when the dependent variable is not log transformed?
1. Plot the results of that model. 
1. Create an additional model that includes a quadratic in a continuous variable ($$x+x^2$$). 
1. Test whether the quadratic expansion results in better model fit. Comment on the results of the test. 
1. Plot the results of the model with a quadratic in one of the independent variables. 
1. In a word document, write up your results, including descriptions of the graphics and the tables.
