## Assignment 6

1. Using the plans dataset, specify a model that uses math scores as the dependent variable and contains at least two interactions.
2. Plot the interaction at least four different ways, using both bar plots and line plots.
3. Create a table that shows predictions and confidence intervals from the complex interactions in at least two different ways.
4. Create an additional model (does not need to be nested) that includes a non-linear transform (log transform or quadratic).
5. Plot the results of that model. 
6. In a word document, write up your results, including descriptions of the graphics and the tables.
