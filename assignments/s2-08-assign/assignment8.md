**Assignment 8**


1. Using your own dataset, run a regression using a continuous variable as your dependent
variable and several regressors. Report the results of at least two model
specifications in a nice table.

2. Test for collinearity in the model. Describe the results of your test and say what
you have decided to do as a result.

3. Test for heteroskedacity in the model. Describe the results of your test and say
what you have decided to do as a result.

4. Decide if any of your variables need to be rescaled and do so if necessary.

5. Check on the functional form of your model using graphical approaches. Include
some of these graphics in your paper.

6. If you decide the functional form needs to change, describe the changes made.
Submit the descriptions of these tests and any tables or graphics generated in a
Word or PDF document.
