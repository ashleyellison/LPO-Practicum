## Assignment 9

Use either your data or the plans data to complete the following steps:

1. Create a table of baseline equivalence, that shows how various whether or not there are significant differences among the control variables as a function of your treatment variable. 

2. Run a regression across both your full sample and various subsamples, reporting the results for just your key independent variable or variables in a table. 

3. Create a graphic that shows how the relationship between one of your key independent variables and your dependent variable varies by levels of another variable. Repeat that graphic for various subsamples of the data. (hint: use grc1leg2)
