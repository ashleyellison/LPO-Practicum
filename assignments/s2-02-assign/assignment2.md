**Assignment 2**

Please complete the following steps, using the mroz dataset available on
github. The Mroz datasets comes from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, and was used as part of a famous study on women’s labor force
participation. For this assignment, you will model the correlates of
women’s labor force outcomes.

1.  Create a macro called y, and assign its value to the variable hours

2.  Create three other macros, named family, husband, and qualifcations.
    Place in each macro a set of variables related to family
    characteristics, husband’s labor force characteristics, and the
    woman’s labor force qualifications.

3.  Create a summary table of all of the variables from above, including
    both means and standard deviations.

4.  Run a total of four regressions. The first three should have y as
    the dependent variable and each “cluster” of variables represented
    by a macro as the sole set of independent variables. The last should
    have all of the independent variables on the right hand side.

5.  Repeat the above step, but reassign the macro y to an alternative
    labor force outcome for the woman (your choice).

6.  In a single paragraph (no more than 150 words), comment on the
    results of your estimation. This should be a comment in the do file.

Submit to me a do file that accomplishes all of the above steps.
