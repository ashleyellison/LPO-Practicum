Assignment 6
============

Complete the following steps with your data. Do at least one task for
each number. I'm being purposefully vague; just show you know how to use
some of the programming commands that we talked about:

1.  Create a switch for loading your own data.
2.  Use the programming code learned in class to recode for missing data
    and to otherwise clean your datasets.
3.  Use the programming code learned in class to deal with
    categorical variables.
4.  Rename and label your binary variables so they are meaningful.
5.  Use the programming code learned in class to describe your data
    (means, standard errors, and graphs where appropriate).
