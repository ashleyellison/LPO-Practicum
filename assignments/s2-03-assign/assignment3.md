# Assignment 3

Using the api dataset,(https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/stata/seminars/svy_stata_intro/apipop) complete the following steps for each type of school: elementary,
middle school, and high schools. Do this by creating a loop structure around the following
steps.

1. Create a series of macros, one for each of the following characteristics of schools: parents,
teachers and student.

2. Create a table of descriptive statistics for these variables using the esttab command.
Make sure it is clearly labeled.

3. Generate a table of conditional means of api00 as a function of other interesting independent
variables.

4. Create a scatterplot or scatterplots that display some of the key relationships in the data.
Clearly label this scatterplot.

5. Run a series of regressions, one for each “set” of characteristics and one fully specified
model, with api00 as the dependent variable.

6. Report the results of your regression in a beautifully formatted table.

7. Create a graphic the shows the impact of the various independent variables on the outcome
variable. Clearly label and describe this graphic.

Submit a do file that will accomplish all of these steps. Submit a word file that includes all
of your graphics and tables.
