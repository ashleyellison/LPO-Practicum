Course Overview
===============

The overview includes an introduction to the course, guidelines on
grading, and required texts.

Introduction
------------

This course is the second of a three semester series of courses designed
to introduce you to the *practice* of research, particularly the applied
side of quantitative research. The goal of this course to help you to
prepare a paper that can be presented at a major research conference
and, hopefully, submitted to a journal for publication.

During this semester you will use multiple regression in order to
analyze the research question you identified last semester.

Grading
-------

Evaluation for the course will be based on the following factors:

*Assignments: 50%*

There will be weekly assignments, which will be graded. Late assignments
will not be accepted. These assignments will account for half of your
grade. Collaboration on assignments is fine, however, many of the
assignments will ask you to work with variables and datasets of your own
choosing.

*Replication File: 50%*

Texts
-----

Baum, C (2006) *An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using STATA*.
College Station: STATA Press

Long, J.S. (2009) *The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata*. College
Station: STATA Press

For this semester, both of these books are *optional*: I will recommend
a few chapters from both as the semester progresses, but the class notes
are the only required reading.

Software
--------

You need to have access to a working version of Stata, (at least v
13.0). Stata is installed on computers on Peabody campus, including
Wyatt 132, and on stations in the Peabody library. You are not required
to purchase Stata, but you will need to use it for class assignments.

If you do purchase Stata, you will need Stata IC (standard version).
Vanderbilt has what’s called a gradplan with Stata under which you can
purchase the software at greatly reduced prices. Stata SE is a
more-powerful version of Stata that is useful for the larger datasets
many of you may be working with.

Honor Code {#sec:honor-code}
----------

For this course, you are bound by the terms of the Peabody Honor System.
Any breach of academic honesty, including cheating, plagiarism, or
failing to report a known or suspected violation of the Code will be
reported to the Honor Council. In particular, papers must assign credit
to the sources you use. Material borrowed from another–quotations,
paraphrases, key words, or ideas–must be credited following appropriate
citation procedures (footnotes and bibliography). As mentioned above,
collaboration *is* permitted on assignments but *is not* permitted on
your summary paper and codebook.

If you have any doubts, please ask me for clarification. Uncertainty
about the application of the Honor Code does not excuse a violation.
