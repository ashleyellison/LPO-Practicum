Git and Github
================
Will Doyle

Installing git
--------------

`git` is a version control program. A standard problem in programming is how to track the changes that have been made to a project. These challenges are well-known to anyone who has had to work on a complex document, particularly with collaborators. Because these problems are particularly severe in programming, they developed a set of tools called version control. These will keep track of every change you make to a file, and record why you made the change.

Download git here and accept all of the defaults on installation: (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)

Getting set up on GitHub
------------------------

GitHub is online hosting service that is widely used by programmers. It allows you to easily share your work with the world. It is integrated with git, so version control is easy to do. If you haven't already, go to (<https://github.com>) and sign up for free to get a username. Share the username with me as soon as you have one.

Initializing repos
------------------

Everyone in the class will need a repository (repo from now on) on our GitHub organization. All I need from you is your username on GitHub, then I can add your repo to our organization.

Git Kraken
----------

Gitkraken is graphical user interface to git. You'll need to download gitkraken here: <https://www.gitkraken.com/> . Once you have the program, open it up and then log in. Once logged in, go back to github.com and go to your repository, click on the link for clone or download, then copy the repo link. Go to gitkraken, then go to clone, and paste in the link. The files will then be loaded onto your computer.

Save, stage, commit, push
-------------------------

When working on your computer, you'll want to save files as normal. Once you have decided a file needs to be tracked (this will be true for all assignments) you need to stage it. This means that git will start keeping track of it. Once you're at a point where you would like to keep track of all of the changes made, you will need to commit the file. This means that you will have a record of the changes made. Last, once you're ready to share the files with others, you need to push the file. This means it will be uploaded to your repository on github. The opposite of push is pull, which means pulling down all of the changes that your collaborators have made from github.
