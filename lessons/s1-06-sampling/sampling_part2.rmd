#### PURPOSE

In the last lecture, we discussed a number of ways to properly
estimate the means and variances of complex survey designs. In this
lecture, we'll discuss how to use Stata's internal `svy` commands and
various variance estimation methods to more easily and correctly
estimate what we want.

## Complex survey designs: Cluster sampling and stratification

In the NCES surveys you'll be using this semester, the designers
combined a design that includes multistage cluster sampling with
stratification. In ECLS, for example, the designers designated
counties as *PSUs*. They next stratified the sample by creating strata
that combined census region with msa status, percent minority, and per
capita income. They then randomly selected schools within each *PSU*
(schools were the *SSUs*) and then randomly selected kindergarteners
within each school (students were the *TSUs*). They then created two
strata for each school with Asian and Pacific Islander students in one
stratum and all other students in the other. Students were randomly
sampled within this second stratum. The target number of children per
school was 24.

Weights in complex survey designs such as the one employed with ECLS
are calculated via the same that we discussed in the last
lecture. Nothing changes except for the layers of complexity. The good
news, however, is that we a researchers don't have to compute the
weights ourselves. Instead, we can use information provided by the
survey makers.  

The *PSUs* that are provided by NCES are what is known as "analysis
*PSUs*". They aren't the identifier for the actual school or
student. Instead, they are allocated within strata (many times 2 *PSU*
per strata). Strata themselves may be analysis strata, that is, not
the same strata that were used to run the survey. Oftentimes, this is
done in service of further protecting the anonimity of
participants. As far your analyses go, the end result is the same, but
sometimes this can be a source of confusion.

## Variance estimation in complex survey designs

There are four common options for estimating variance in complex
survey designs:

  1. Taylor series linearized estimates
  2. Balanced repeated replication (BRR) estimates
  3. Jackknife estimates
  4. Bootstrap estimates
  
Remember that these are all estimates: you cannot directly compute the
variance of quantities of interest from complex surveys. Instead, you
must use one of these techniques, with trade-offs for each. We'll be
using a couple of datasets for this lesson:

  * *nhanes*, which is a health survey conducted using a complex
  survey design that comes with a variety of weights   
  * *nmihs_bs*, which is a survey of births that comes with bootstrap
  replicate weights

Let's start with the *nhanes* dataset from which we'd like to get
average height weight and age for the US population. First, let's get
the naive estimate:  

```{r}
start <- 'load data from web, nhanes2f'
end <- 'explore survey design'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

We can also take a look at the sampling design, particularly the
designation of strata and *PSUs*: 

```{r}
start <- 'explore survey design'
end <- 'mean with probability weights'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

We can use the weights supplied with *nhanes* to get accurate
estimates of the means, but the variance estimates will be off:

```{r}
start <- 'mean with probability weights'
end <- 'TAYLOR SERIES LINEARIZED ESTIMATES'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

## `svyset` and `svy: <command>`

To aid in the analysis of complex survey data, Stata has incorporated
the `svyset` command and the `svy:` prefix, with its suite of
commands. With `svyset`, you can set the *PSU* (and *SSU* and *TSU* if
applicable), the weights, and the type of variance estimation along
with the variance weights (if applicable). Once set, most Stata
estimation commands such as `mean` can be combined with `svy:` in
order to produce correct estimates.

## Variance estimators

### Taylor series linearized estimates

Taylor series linearized estimates are based on the general strategy
of Taylor series estimation, which is used to linearize a non-linear
function in order to describe the function in question. In this case,
a Taylor series is used to approximate the function, and the
variance of the result is the estimate of the variance.

The basic intuition behind a linearized estimate is that the variance
in a complex survey will be a nonlinear function of the set of
variances calculated within each stratum. We can calculate these, then
use the first derivative of the function that would calculate the
actual variance as a first order approximation of the actual
variance. This works well enough in practice. To do this, you
absolutely must have multiple *PSUs* in each stratum so you can
calculate variance within each stratum.  

This is the most common method and is used as the default by
Stata. You must, however, have within-stratum variance among *PSUs*
for this to work, which means that you must have at least two *PSUs*
per stratum. This lonely PSU problem is common and difficult to deal
with. We'll return the lonely PSU later.  

To set up a dataset to use linearized estimates in Stata, we use the
`svyset` command:

```{r}
start <- 'TAYLOR SERIES LINEARIZED ESTIMATES'
end <- 'compute mean using svy pre-command and taylor series estimates'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

Now that we've set the data, every time we want estimates that reflect
the sampling design, we use the `svy: <command>` format: 

```{r}
start <- 'compute mean using svy pre-command and taylor series estimates'
end <- 'BRR ESTIMATES'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```

<br>

As you can see, the parameter estimates (means) are exactly the same
as using the weighted sample, but the standard errors are quite
different: nearly twice as large for age, but actually smaller for
weight.

### Balanced repeated replication (BRR) estimates

In a balanced repeated replication (BRR) design, the quantity of
interests is estimated repeatedly by using half the sample at a
time. In a survey which is designed with BRR in mind, each sampling
stratum contains two *PSUs*. BRR proceeds by estimating the quantity
of interest from one of the *PSUs* within each stratum. For *H* strata,
\(2^H\) replications are done, and the variance of the quantity of interest
across these strata forms the basis for the estimate.

BRR weights are usually supplied with a survey. These weights result
in appropriate half samples being formed across strata. BRR weights
should generally be used when the sample was designed with them in
mind, and not elsewhere. This can be a serious complication when
survey data are subset.

To get variance estimates using BRR in stata, you either need to have
a set of replicate weights set up or you need to create a set of
balanced replicates yourself. If the data has BRR weights it's simple:  

```{r}
start <- 'load data from web, nhanes2brr'
end <- 'load data from web, nhanes2 no brr'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

If you don't have the data set up this way, you need to create a Hadamard
with dimensions equal to the number of strata. Hadamard
matrices are special in that they are square matrices comprised of 1s
and -1s that arranged in such a way that each row and column sums to
zero (equal numbers of ones and negative ones) and adjacent
rows/columns are orthogonal (correlation of zero).

```{r}
start <- 'load data from web, nhanes2 no brr'
end <- 'use our BRR weighting matrix with svy'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

Now that we've made our matrix, we can use it with the BRR command to
get our estimates:

```{r}
start <- 'use our BRR weighting matrix with svy'
end <- 'JACKNIFE ESTIMATES'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

### Jackknife estimates

The Jackknife is a general strategy for variance estimation, so named
by Tukey because of its general usefulness. The strategy for creating
a jackknifed estimate is to delete every observation save one, then
estimate the quantity of interest. This is repeated for every single
observation in the dataset. The variance of every estimate computed
provides an estimate of the variance for the quantity of interest.

In a complex sample, this is done by *PSUs*, deleting each *PSU* one
at a time and re-weighting the observations within the stratum, then
calculating the parameter of interest. The variance of these
parameters estimates is the within-stratum variance estimate. The
within stratum variances calculated this way are then averaged across
strata to give the final variance estimate.

The jackknife is best used when Taylor series estimation cannot be
done, for instance in the case of lonely *PSUs*.

In Stata, the command is:

```{r}
start <- 'load data from web, nhanes2jknife'
end <- 'compute naive means without jackknife weights'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

Now we can compare the naive estimates with the `svyset` estimates:

```{r}
start <- 'compute naive means without jackknife weights'
end <- 'BOOTSTRAP ESTIMATES'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

### Bootstrap estimates

The bootstrap is a more general method than the
jackknife. Bootstrapping involves repeatedly resampling within the
sample itself and generating estimates of the quantity of
interest. The variance of these replications (usually many, many
replications) provides an estimate of the total variance. In NCES
surveys, within stratum bootstrapping can be used, with the sum of the
variances obtained used as an estimate of the population
variance. Bootstrapping is an accurate, but computationally intense
method of variance estimation.

As with the jackknife, bootstrapping must be accomplished by deleting
each *PSU* within the stratum one at a time, re-weighting, calculating
the estimate, than calculating the bootstrap variance estimate from
the compiled samples.  

```{r}
start <- 'load data from web, nmihs_bs'
end <- 'end file'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

## Lonely *PSUs*

The most common problem that students have with complex surveys is
what is known as "lonely *PSUs*." When you subset the data, you may very
well end up with a sample that does not have mutliple *PSUs* per
stratum. There are several options for what do in this case:

  * Eliminate the offending data by dropping strata with singleton
  *PSUs*. This is a terrible idea.
  * Reassign the *PSU* to a neighboring stratum. This is okay, but you
  must have a reason why you're doing this.
  * Assign a variance to the stratum with a singleton *PSU*. This
  could be the average of the variance across the other strata. This
  process is also known as "scaling" and generally is okat, but you
  should take a look at how different this stratum is from the others
  before proceeding.
  
The svyset command includes three possible options for dealing with
loney *PSUs*. Based on the above, I recommend you use the
`singleunit(scaled)` command, but with caution and full knowledge of
the implications for your estimates.
