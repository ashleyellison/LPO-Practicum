#### PURPOSE

Describing the data in your sample is one of the most important steps
in reporting on your research. A reader that has a clear
understanding of the patterns in your data will be able to readily
understand your more complex analyses.

The key to descriptive statistics turns out to be the humble
conditional mean: the mean of the dependent variable at various levels
of the independent variable. Master the conditional mean and how to
display it, and everyone will always remember your papers and
presentations.

#### HEADER

Incidental to the lesson today, but important to set up correctly is
the header. Notice that the plot and table files types are saved in global
macros. With a quick switch at the top of the file, you can change the file
format of the plots and tables that Stata saves. Very handy.

```{r}
start <- 'set link for data, plot, and table directories'
end <- 'DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```

## Tables

Every manuscript should include a table of descriptive statistics,
listing the mean and standard error or standard deviation of every
variable to be used in the dataset. In addition, tables should be used
to convey crosstabs of two categorical variables. Most of your
papers will also eventually include tables for regression
results. Tables should be used sparingly for describing data: your
best bet is almost always graphics.

For many categorical variables, however, tables may be your only
option. In that case you need to think hard about two things:

  1. How can I best show patterns in the conditional mean of my
     dependent variable at different levels of my independent
     variables?
  2. How can I best show relationships among key independent
     variables?

## Principles for displaying data

Tufte (2001) lists the following principles for describing data using
graphics. He says they should:  

  * Show the data
  * Induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about
  the methodology, graphic design, the technology production, or
  something else.
  * Avoid distorting what the data have to say.
  * Present many numbers in a small space.
  * Make large datasets coherent.
  * Encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data.
  * Reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview
  to fine structure.
  * Serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration,
  tabulation, or decoration.
  * Be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions
  of a dataset.

## Describing variation and central tendency in continuous variables

### Plots

The two key tools for describing variation and central tendency in a
continuous variable are the kernel density plot and the histogram. A
histogram should be your first choice for most variables: the key
decisions will be the number of bins or the frequency of the
plot. Histograms can also be combined across levels using the
onewayplot command.

The basic histogram is shown here.

```{r}
start <- 'histogram of base year math score'
end <- 'spikeplot of base year math score'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('hist_bynels2m.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

At the extreme end of the histogram is the "spike" plot, which has a single line
for every level of the underlying variable.

```{r}
start <- 'spikeplot of base year math score'
end <- 'kernel density plot of base year math score'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('spike_bynels2m.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

Kernel density plots are a key tool for describing a continuous
variable. The density of the variable can be compared to standard
densities for visual comparison, like in the first plot below. Kernel
density plots can be particularly illuminating when displayed across
multiple levels of a categorical variable, as in the second plot
below.  

```{r}
start <- 'kernel density plot of base year math score'
end <- 'BASIC DESCRIPTIVE TABLE'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('kd_bynels2m.png', 'center'))
writeLines(alignfigure('kd_bynels2m_cond.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

#### QUICK EXERCISE
> Display a histogram for byses1. Next show a kernel density plot with
> `byses1` for students whose father went to postsecondary education and
> overlay the density of students whose father did not go to
> postsecondary education.

<br>

### Tables

For tables describing continuous variables, the industry standard is a
table of means and standard errors or standard deviations. Below is a
table of means and standard errors, nicely formatted.  

```{r}
start <- 'BASIC DESCRIPTIVE TABLE'
end <- 'use tabstat to make table'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
#writeLines(includetable('means_se.html', 'center'))
```
<br>

You can also use standard deviations, which even in survey data like
yours are based on the simple sample standard deviation
calculation. Table 2 shows means and standard deviations.  

```{r}
start <- 'use tabstat to make table'
end <- 'CATEGORICAL VARIABLE'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
#writeLines(includetable('means_sd.html', 'center'))
```

#### QUICK EXERCISE
> Create a table that includes all of the above variables but also sex
> and race. Choose whether to include standard errors or standard
> deviations.

## Describing categorical or binary variables

### Plots

The first question is: do you need to? What can you present in a
graphic that wouldnâ€™t be in a table or couldn't be described in the text?
That said, some options include a histogram for categorical variables
(bar chart) and a table of proportions.  

Below is code for a barchart.

```{r}
start <- 'barchart of base year student expectations'
end <- 'proportions table for base year student expectations'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('bar_bystexp.png', 'center'))
```

<br>

### Tables

A table of proportions is a way to display information regarding a
single categorical variable. Here is a simple table of
proportions.

```{r}
start <- 'proportions table for base year student expectations'
end <- 'KEY DEPENDENT VARIABLE IN RELATION TO OTHER INDEPENDENT VARIABLES'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
#writeLines(includetable('proportions.html', 'center'))
```
<br>

#### QUICK EXERCISE
> Create a nicely formatted bar chart and table showing the
> proportions of students with different levels of parental
> education.

## Describing relationships between two continuous variables

### Plots

The scatterplot is the ultimate tool in describing relationships
between two continuous variables. All scatterplots should always have
the dependent variable on the *y* axis and the independent variable on
the *x* axis. Both axes must be labeled clearly. Limits should be set
based on the data: there's no need to include a 0 in every graph. This
can in fact be counterproductive.

The code below produces a simple scatterplot of math and reading scores.

```{r}
start <- 'math against reading scores in scatterplot'
end <- 'scatterplot with 10 percent sample of data'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('sc_math_read.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

Notice how there are too many dots; just blob reall. You may find it
useful to plot only a random (representative) subsample of your
data. Here is a better version of the above scatterplot that only uses
10% of the data. 

```{r}
start <- 'scatterplot with 10 percent sample of data'
end <- 'conditional scatterplot with 25 percent sample of data'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('sc_math_read_10.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

Finally, you can condition on another variable in order to add another
level to your scatter plot. This can be done both with use of `if`
statements, as in the first plot below, and `by` statements, as in the
second plot.

```{r}
start <- 'conditional scatterplot with 25 percent sample of data'
end <- 'conditional scatterplot with by'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('sc_complex.png', 'center'))
```

```{r}
start <- 'conditional scatterplot with by'
end <- 'matrix plot'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('sc_cond.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

You can also run a scatter plot across levels of a categorical
variable if you suspect the underlying relationship may not be the
same in each level of the categorical variable. The `matrix` plot
helpfully with plot each combination of included varibles against each
other to produe a sort of "small multiples" correlation plot.

```{r}
start <- 'matrix plot'
end <- 'boxplot of math score over categories of race/ethnicity'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('matrix_plot.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

## Describing relationships between a categorical and a continuous variable

### Plots
There are multiple options for plotting the relationship between a
categorical and a continuous variable. A particularly useful option is
to plot the continuous variable as a series of boxplots, one for each
level of the categorical variable.

#### Boxplots

For boxplots to be effective, they should be sorted by the median of
the dependent variable. This contrast is shown in the two figures below.  

```{r}
start <- 'boxplot of math score over categories of '
end <- 'dot plots of continuous against categorical'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('box1.png', 'center'))
writeLines(alignfigure('box2.png', 'center'))
```
<br>

#### Dot plots

Dot plots can also be useful for plotting the measure of central
tendency across groups. In this case, we'll produce two plots, one
each for reading and math scores, and then combine them into a single
graphic.  

```{r}
start <- 'dot plots of continuous against categorical'
end <- 'TABPLOT'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('dot_both.png', 'center'))
```
<br>
 
## Describing relationships between two categorical variables

### Plots

The basic tool for comparing two categorical variables is the
crosstabulation. In a crosstabulation we take a look at counts of the
sample that are identified by their presence in cells created by the
two categorical variables. There are several tools for plotting
categorical variables, including tabplots, jittered plots, and
heatmaps.

#### Tabplots

Below are examples of a tabplot, with both two and three dimensions.

```{r}
start <- 'TABPLOT'
end <- 'jitter categorical against categorical'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('tabplot1.png', 'center'))
writeLines(alignfigure('tabplot2.png', 'center'))
```

<br>

#### Jitter plot

```{r}
start <- 'jitter categorical against categorical'
end <- 'heatmap of base year student plans and parental education'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('jitterplot.png', 'center'))
```

<br>

#### Heatmap

```{r}
start <- 'heatmap of base year student plans and parental education'
end <- 'table using weights directly'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
writeLines(alignfigure('heatmap.png', 'center'))
```

<br>

### Tables

When checking crosstabulations, we can produce two-way tables that
include survey weights in the command itself.

```{r}
start <- 'table using weights directly'
end <- 'cross table of categorical'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
<br>

Of course, if we want to use a table in a paper, we should use
`esttab`.

```{r}
start <- 'cross table of categorical'
end <- 'end file'
writeLines(logparse(lf, start = start, end = end))
```
```{r, results = 'asis'}
#writeLines(includetable('race_tab.html', 'center'))
```
