Course Overview
===============

The overview includes an introduction to the course, guidelines on
grading, and required texts.

Introduction
------------

This course is the final of a three semester series of courses designed
to introduce you to the *practice* of research, particularly the applied
side of quantitative research. The goal of this course to help you to
prepare a paper that can be presented at a major research conference
and, hopefully, submitted to a journal for publication.

During this session, we will work as a group to refine and improve your
analysis. By the end of the term, each of you will have a completed
paper suitable for presentation at a major research conference.

Along the way, you will continue to develop the same set of skills you
have been working on all year, along with some more specific set of
techniques that I will spend the first week describing.

Grading
-------

Evaluation for the course will be based on the following factors:

Final Paper
:   The final paper should be a publication-ready manuscript, reporting
    the results of the analysis conducted over the course of the year.
    You will need to turn in a replication file with this paper. This
    will be worth 100% of your grade. The paper will be due at midnight
    on June 11.

Presentation
:   You will give a presentation based on your paper on May 26. The
    presentation will be in preparation for the presentation you will
    give to all students and faculty in the fall. I will give you
    feedback on this presentation along with the rest of the class.

Software
--------

Stata will again be the order of the day for this semester.
